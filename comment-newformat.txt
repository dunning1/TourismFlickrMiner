2748544305	very cool!	
13944279311	Either you were too late or too early, as the shadow/ light are fighting each other in this one. But again the detail is great.	Thanks Bob - think you're right re the shadow and light balance. I learnt something - the more animals on the corner of a traditional sacred building like this the more important it is! Tis building is of moderate  significance/ The highest number of animals I saw was 11! (coming soon)

don't let your cats see this photo, they might get piss off at you.	awww, poor babies. To be a stray dog in China might be very dangerous.	They had owners. They live at the store.	What a relief! I'm glad they have owners.

2740697380	Oh sweet! So many people in the spirit. It's great to see.	
3780414699	This is not a gravity-free area.  The gravity-free area is past the security checkpoints...	Wait...is it telling me that in order to be cautious I must drop down?

Like:  &quot;Hey Buddy,  Duck!&quot;

176475655	awesome sculpture piece.	
125672077	It looks like the most advanced game of Ker-Plunk that man could wish for...	which bird is that?	I think its the fabulous bird out of &quot;Sinbad the sailor&quot;, or possibly the one from &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; that produces those particularly soft feathers with which it is a pleasure to wipe one's arse, sorry this is a family site, one's nose

Don t fuck with the jesus (quintana) :)	
130085699	I'd be tempted to call this one &quot;Temple of the Bomb&quot;.  Great photo - the composition is striking.	Indeed... reminiscent of the scene at the end of &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;	Okay you win, renamed!  :)	Yeah!  What did I win?  LOL  
Douglas, thats what I was thinking also, however, it reminded me to &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; (the one where they worship the bomb).	This really makes me miss the good old days when these commies would get uppity.....then we'd just send the US seventh naval fleet to the China Sea and they'd shut up and get back into their place.	Great picture...!	Where is this?	In Beijing.	
6714451363	interesting capture, looks like a canon	Excellent composition and capture.	
3941865846	This is a wonderful set - amazing colours and details.	I agree - the set and colors and wonderful!!

3918370009	what kind of lens you are using?	This is a minolta minolux 35mm f:2. It is the lens from a leica CL.	
321488162	This reminds me of Escher's &quot;Three Worlds&quot;	
219815484	Wow!  The land is so beautiful!  Amazing photo!	wow!! amazing capture!	
297154993	The guy on the right is doing his beatles' abbey road impression.	Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href="/groups/301961@N24/">Sinister Architecture</a>, and we'd love to have your photo added to the group.

5687389133	...beautiful	
5184117242	nicely photographed.	ah. Its good to see the great wall empty of people. The last time I went to Beijing was in 2000 and (*shudder*) over a time when the whole of china was on holiday. All you could see were heads and it was impossible to find a way to move.	It was still somewhat crowded but definitely not wall-to-wall people (no pun intended... okay maybe some pun).  Since this was in November, I assume that's not the height of the tourist season.  We were there however during the period of time when the US consulate in China tweeted the air quality of Beijing as being &quot;crazy bad&quot;.

7549675812	hehe neeeeeeeeeerd!	
5771071296	These two are really getting down to business. Love the small chair!	Amazing place	Great moment. Seems a good business to be in as fish in Bj seem to have a very short life span.

3576282835	A button allows you to choose the colour of your room as seen from the outside.	Looks googley, with all those colors and the G.

443387999	BeiJing ?	
5922189243	great shot!!	
125146346	Yeah, who is it?	Is that an Olympic hat you're wearing?	Yep, I'm ready for 2008, but Beijing is one giant construction zone, actually several giant construction areas. They won't be ready for a while yet, but they're getting there...	
2731765988	Nice!	
4847514963	What were you taking a photo of?  How close your knee is to the dash?

4476424728	Great pic !	Stunning light rays.	excellent city picture... close to sci-fi and all that gotham city mood i like so very much.... the title is curious and that it's a part of the set &quot;night&quot; is just perfect. all the little windows... like it a lot.

9182739573	OK. . .I can't favorite ALL these.  But she is a beauty, and you did a fabulous job on this shoot.	
137289229	You are really doing a great job with depth of field effects Piero. Great stuff.

3578099464	i like this shot Peiyu, it's so simple and minimal and you composed well this photo making it interesting.

viewing this shot i can feel a sense of shyness... and the camera seems repulsed.

nice idea and good shot Peiyu!	
11717640524	Buon Anno Tut	
3435851674	Oh very nice eye.	
247594443	Great shot!	i love all the kool kids	Did you happen to know everyone you photographed? I had the hardest time in the world convincing people to let me photograph them. When I'd ask in Chinese if it was okay and I had my camera ready to go, strangers would politely refuse 90% of the time. The other 10% don't pose naturally.

I don't understand why it should be so hard... is there something you say to put them at ease and let you photo them?	
6250396821	Neat!	
1147810869	I see 5 plates of food - and a beer,... no wonder you are smiling!

316928577	what's this?	$0.10 for a pair of what?	
458653293	This photo is very beautiful	
2145176434	sometimes I find it hard to look at these fashion shots cos' my eye and brain reads &quot;commercial&quot;  and  &quot;supermarket showing it's goods&quot; - but I must say that these dresses are purely woo wicked and very arty - arty fartzy - in the positive way. Like manipulated or simpy out of this world.	i hear ya JO+
i'm payin my dues. :P	
4394778226	hmmm, i'll get a pant like that, xixi	haha! awesome

336668089	interesting - who's the little girl turning away ?	Hi Vlad !
That's my girl :-)). She was five at the time.

@Bravo JoJo4Art, Fanch The System &amp; @Vlad : You are the winners : I'm thinking about some good award for you my friends.	Fun photo and photo fun!	
2206189604	it must be a hell being in an airport that is actually by the chinese!	
10974768223	You're right... Pipits are hard ;-)
With all that grey and buff, it's not either Richard's or Blyth's. Now you know everything that I know about pipits :-)	I started to comment on this earlier. Thinking it was probably some eastern race Water Pipit then chickened out ! :-)
Taking in to account the location and the apparent pinkiness I started to think Rosy Pipit(Anthus roseatus)	Oddly the IUCN range maps for both species have neither in Beijing. But the Avibase checklist for Heibei province gives <i>A.  rubescens</i> (Buff-bellied).Wikipedia hhas a cited statement that &quot;Water and Buff-bellied Pipit do not co-occur except in a small area in Central Asia&quot;.
So never mind the plumage, the web says its Buff-bellied.	Thanks all.  I'm inclined to think this is a Buff-bellied Pipit, based on your responses and the fact that it does not look substantially different enough from others that I saw that day (lighter grey and more pronounced supercilium, but otherwise similar.)   They look different than the American Pipits that I'm used to seeing (mostly in wintertime), and its hard to believe they are the same species.	
2541999766	Finally.	finally ... what?	a man's dream illustrated as thus.	
6632303997	Great detail!	Nice!	interesting shot

112128844	Uh. What was the name of that brand with three stripes, again? ;)	
3228091654	Haha. The title made me laugh. I read it expecting some total knockout then this silly looking fox hat caught me by surprise. I still like it a lot. &lt;3	haha... the ole bait and switch!

275147616	But can you buy them in Adelaide from people offering to do an extra special price <i>just</i> for you? At least they're better than the 2002 Korea / Japan World Cup mascots Ato, Kaz and Nik.	aha, no, sadly. Love the bartering, though, and the 'personalised' price negotiations...
These came via my dad who recieved countless soft toy mascots when he was in China for business. I think there'll be lots of Aus kiddies with these toys under their arms as gifts from 'Daddy'...	
87171312	Wow. You got some terrific Great Wall shots!	Very cool. I'm so jealous that you got to go here.	Thanks! It was a hazy day, so I took a bunch of shots hoping that some would turn out.

This is the first time I've seen pictures of it, so thanks, I've been inspired to go now!	I'm glad it inspired you, 1980 :).  The Old Summer Palace definitely beats the other one for tranquility.

2795431795	hello!!!	
2444825697	You have to wonder where these Chinese national flags came from.	I asked the students and they wouldn't say anything more than that they came from China. I found it suspicious too.	
487874033	nice

40114965	terrific capture	
7325139168	Hermosa toma !!

581603311	love it!

5070645457	hum... It could be really interesting if the frame would not cut his head. I like the colours.	Unfortunately I was too shy and took he picture quickly and from a distance (this is a crop). But yeah good point it would be much better if the painting was just over his head like a comic caption.	
2225146359	yeah! she lives! I thought you got eaten by a tuna.

This is really cool. I remember being a kiddie in GF and thinking the trees formed a cathedral ceiling over the street (this was before Dutch Elm Disease hit, sadly) This photo echoes that, while also giving the impression that these people are headed on a long journey. I dig.	yes! this totally reminded me of central avenue- i think of that street any time i see trees like this.	
1195138574	interesting!
on many occasions, the taxi stopped for the Chinese dude when in actual reality I had waved first! and then they'd go off smiling and waving at me as if it were sth to be proud of!	
4716831440	Aaaaaaaaaaggg!!!!! (but good shot)

3457531922	This is a really great shot.  I like the way you have positioned the couple in the lower left quarter, dwarfed by the digital image in the background.  Also really like the muted colours.	
2400651489	i want that!!	
10854186966	Beautiful!	
5240155303	A temple? I love the white on white.	Yup. It's the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.	this is such a strangely beautiful capture (:

2755945817	aww cute.	
1149723067	so strange. i was just today changing the itunes album artwork for dark side because somehow it had downloaded the 30th anniversary edition CD cover and not the older and much nicer LP cover. but now i'm thinking maybe i should change it to this instead.	
3004359647	nice

6758907323	good!!	
2417062709	That's the Beijing I remember. Have you seen anyone delivering a piano by bicycle? I did.

I heard they are tearing up the bikeways to make room for more roads. But it looks like the still have plenty of bikes.	Plenty of bikes, lots of cars.  Lots of bike lanes too, though.  No piano seen, but just about everything else.  Laundry to beer to food to construction material... Pretty tough to beat the efficiency for short trips.	
2596698782	yay for hannah!

419924296	These Beijing people shots are excellent!

107527896	love this series mr zoom. it really feels like it really feels.

Hope you had a wonderful time there :-)

1503642652	Wonderful photo. Congratulations. 
But doesn't it show how absurd it was to write at such length in such small chracters on such a huge tablet some 25 feet tall. 
But still, the Qianlong Emperor had his tablet created for posterity even if it was exactly the same as all the other tablets presented to the Temple by previous emperors.

It was a nice trip.  But in the above shot, you can see what looks like haze.  That's a thick layer of pollution.  Them's some tasty hydrocarbons floating in the air.  I'll be processing a few more pictures in the next couple of days.

go go taiwan	Did you realize why Taiwan just elected the guy that advocate for good China Taiwan relationship instead of independence? The guy for independence was not elected. Does that tell you anything at all? Again quit telling us that we don't know what human right is.	To me, it doesn't matter who win or lose in Taiwan Election this year. 
It matters that Taiwan has human right to vote who is right president for 'YOU' to be Taiwan's president. Don't you think this is called &quot;human right&quot; after all.

LOL	For all those that think the Dalia Lama is a holy man--look him up in Wikipedia. He was trained by he CIA to hold an ARMED uprising against the government-off course he failed and so he's in exiled in India---now ask yourself this, if any person decided to hold an ARMED uprising against the US--say the Native Americans--wouldn't he be charged with treason and get the death penalty? Considering this fact, China actually gave him a fairly good deal.	Dear American Friends:

How can USA people judge other people's human right issues and yet you tolerated groups of people in the Utah Arizona Texas Area enslaving women and children under pretense of religion? Please explain.	If Tibetan can't vote for their future by China government. &quot;FREE TIBET&quot; China has no any right to keep it as part of China.	Free0808

I guess you don't know about Puerto Rico and how the real american voting system work do you--you ever heard of Electorates? I live in Washington, DC-we cannot vote because we're not a state and has no electorates-does that mean we should break away into a riot to protest this problem?

Who's that girl? From a band or a moderator?	singer for a beijing band +10.  She's korean i think.	
4180317837	How interesting...looks like a reflection...or ceiling light show...great capture!

Thank you for your comments...Your photography is very interesting and I like it very much.

6165957129	<b> majestic structure !</b>	
2491439650	Beautiful... love the contrast and colours... is this Sigma 70-200?  Not bad at all.  I would say 8/10 compare to Nikon 70-200.  Is it heavy?  Nikon 70-200 VR really heavy to hand hold after while.	Yes, it is the Sigma 70 200 2.8. This lens( 1.2kg ) is as big as Nikkor 70 200 2.8 VR.  And it weights 2.0kg when used with D200 or D300 :). 

I would say it is 9/10 compared to Nikkor 70 200 2.8 VR. 
You get everything except VR function. The focus speed is somehow a little slower than that Nikkor lens but it does the job.

If you mainly shoot portrait like me, you won't need that Nikkor lens.

297154994	I'm almost a bit surprised you were allowed to take photos... or maybe they just don't allow it on the anniversary.	Wow, I can't believe you're there.  I, too, am surprised that they allow photos to be taken here, considering.	I'm surprised you could take photos too.  Or maybe you can just out run a tank.
